# Original dependencies that should remain if not covered above
# (cross-reference with initial file and pip freeze output)
# Example: if 'some-package==1.0.0' was in original and not in freeze, it was removed.
# If 'some-package' was in original (no version) and freeze has 'some-package==2.0.0', it's updated.
# The logic here is to ensure all explicitly listed packages from the original requirements.txt
# are present with their new (if upgraded) or original (if not upgraded) versions.

# Final check: ensure all originally listed packages are present
