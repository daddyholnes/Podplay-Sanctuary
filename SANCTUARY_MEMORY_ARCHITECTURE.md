## Memory Architecture Components

### 1. Cross-Platform Context Bridge
```typescript
interface SanctuaryMemory {
  user_context: {
    current_project: ProjectState,
    preference_patterns: UserPreferences,
    emotional_state: EmotionalContext,
    skill_progression: SkillMap,
    recent_conversations: ConversationHistory[]
  },
  
  ai_memory: {
    conversation_continuity: string,
    learned_preferences: PreferenceMap,
    project_insights: ProjectInsight[],
    error_patterns: ErrorPattern[],
    success_celebrations: Achievement[]
  },
  
  platform_sync: {
    vscode_state: WorkspaceState,
    codespace_context: CloudContext,
    jetbrains_integration: IDEState,
    local_environment: LocalState
  }
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Context Restoration
```python
class SanctuaryContextManager:
    def restore_session(self, platform: str, session_id: str):
        # Seamlessly restore user's mental model
        # Continue conversations mid-sentence
        # Restore UI state exactly as left
        # Predict next likely actions
        pass
    
    def sync_across_platforms(self):
        # mem0 integration for persistent memory
        # Real-time context synchronization
        # Preference propagation
        pass
```

## Emotional Intelligence Layer
```typescript
interface EmotionalState {
  energy_level: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' | 'frustrated',
  confidence: 'confident' | 'learning' | 'struggling',
  session_mood: 'exploratory' | 'focused' | 'creative' | 'debugging',
  interaction_preference: 'verbose' | 'concise' | 'visual' | 'hands-on'
}

// AI adapts personality and interface based on emotional context
```
