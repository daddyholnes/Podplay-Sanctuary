## [2025-06-01 21:48+01:00] Sanctuary UI Production Audit & Refactor

### Actions Taken:
- Read and analyzed `podplay-production-plan.md` for all production requirements and module definitions.
- Moved all enhanced UI files to `frontend/src/enhanced/`.
- Replaced the app entrypoint (`App.tsx`) to render ONLY the five enhanced modules:
  - MamaBearMainChat (Main Chat)
  - ScoutMultiModalChat (Scout Agent)
  - WorkspaceLayout (Workspaces)
  - McpMarketplace (MCP Marketplace)
  - DevWorkspaces (Mini Apps/Dev Workspaces)
- Removed all legacy UI, fallback code, and shell components from the frontend.
- Confirmed that only the new, purple-themed, modular UI is renderedâ€”no legacy or fallback present.

### Next Steps:
- Audit each enhanced component for:
  - Shared component usage and modularity
  - State management (Zustand/React Query or equivalent)
  - Real-time backend/API integration
  - Accessibility and sensory-friendly design
  - Consistent purple/calm theming
- Refactor or add code to address any gaps found during audit.
- Continue logging all major changes and decisions in this file.
