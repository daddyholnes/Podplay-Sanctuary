### **What is Scout?**

Scout is an AI-powered research automation platform designed to generate deep, structured research reports using advanced large language models (LLMs) and agent-based workflows. It is modular, extensible, and can integrate with multiple AI providers (such as Gemini and OpenAI). Scout is aimed at users who want to automate the process of gathering, synthesizing, and presenting research from diverse sources with minimal manual intervention[1].

---

### **How Scout Works (Backend Architecture and Workflow)**

#### **1. Modular, Agent-Based System**

- **Modular Design:**  
  Scout’s backend is built with a modular architecture, making it easy to plug in different components or swap out LLM providers as needed. This means you can configure Scout to use various AI models (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI) for different research tasks[1].

- **Agent-Based Research:**  
  The core of Scout is its use of AI agents. Each agent is responsible for a specific part of the research process (e.g., information gathering, synthesis, summarization). These agents are implemented as Python modules and can be configured in the system’s settings[1].  Absolutely! Here’s a detailed walkthrough of the **user experience (UX) on Scout.new**—from initial planning to production, including how users interact with the platform, see their work animate and render, and how the workflow feels end-to-end.

---

## 1. **Onboarding & Planning**

- **Personalized Welcome:**  
  When you log in, Scout greets you by name (“Hey Nathan, Got work? Let’s jam!”) with a soft, animated pastel background that feels inviting and modern.
- **Central Command Bar:**  
  You’re presented with a prominent input bar (“Let Scout do it for you...”), where you can type your task, research goal, or project plan in natural language.
- **Quick Action Buttons:**  
  Below the input, you see clear action buttons: Research, Create, Plan, Analyze, Learn. These help you define the type of workflow you want Scout to orchestrate.
- **AI-First Planning:**  
  As soon as you enter a prompt (e.g., “Plan Multi-LLM App with Gemini API & Scout”), Scout’s AI agent takes over, parsing your intent and suggesting a structured plan or next steps.

---

## 2. **Interactive Workspace**

- **Multi-Panel Layout:**  
  The interface splits into panels:  
  - **Timeline/Tasks:** Shows the sequence of steps, files, and milestones.  
  - **Files/Docs:** Lets you view, edit, and download generated documents (Markdown, requirements, diagrams, etc.).  
  - **Preview/Live Output:** Renders live previews—either of documents, diagrams, or app prototypes.
- **Live Collaboration:**  
  You can see Scout’s agent working in real time—generating files, updating timelines, and refining requirements.  
  - Each step animates into place, so you watch the plan unfold as Scout builds it.
- **File Generation & Editing:**  
  Files (e.g., `multi-llm-app-setup.md`, requirements, diagrams) appear in the file panel, ready for download or further editing.  
  - You can click to open, edit, or export any file.
- **Timeline Animation:**  
  The timeline visually updates as each stage completes, with smooth transitions and progress markers.

---

## 3. **Production & Preview**

- **Live Preview Pane:**  
  When Scout generates something visual (e.g., a diagram, UI mockup, or code output), the preview panel animates the rendering—showing you the result as soon as it’s ready.
  - If the output is a document, you get a formatted, scrollable preview.
  - For apps or UIs, you see a “No app preview available” placeholder until the build completes, then the live app appears.
- **Feedback Loop:**  
  You can send feedback, tweak your prompt, or ask Scout to regenerate or refine any part of the plan.  
  - Scout responds instantly, updating the workspace with new files or steps.
- **Download & Export:**  
  All generated files (docs, code, diagrams) are available for download or direct integration into your workflow.

---

## 4. **End-to-End Animation & Rendering**

- **Everything Animates:**  
  Every action—file creation, timeline updates, preview rendering—uses subtle animations.  
  - Files “drop in” as they’re generated.
  - Timelines fill and steps check off with smooth transitions.
  - Previews fade in or animate to show progress.
- **Seamless Flow:**  
  The experience is continuous and immersive: you never feel lost or have to reload. Scout orchestrates the process, keeping you in the loop visually at every stage.

#### **2. Configurable Workflows**

- **Configuration File:**  
  The research workflow is driven by a JSON config file (`config.json`). This file specifies which agents to use, which LLMs to call, API keys, and other operational parameters. This allows users to customize the research process without changing code[1].

#### **3. Research Execution**

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  
  Users interact with Scout primarily via a CLI (`main_cli.py`). You provide a research topic or question, and Scout orchestrates the agents to gather and process information[1].

- **Automated Clarification:**  
  Scout can prompt users with clarifying questions to refine the research objective before proceeding.

#### **4. Output Generation**

- **Report Formats:**  
  After the research process, Scout outputs structured reports in both Markdown and HTML formats. These reports are stored in an output directory and can include citations, summaries, and detailed findings[1].

- **Logging:**  
  The system logs all research steps in a structured JSON Lines format, aiding traceability and debugging.

#### **5. Extensibility**

- **Provider Integration:**  
  New LLM providers or research agents can be added by extending the `providers` directory and updating the config file.

---

### **Estimated Model Architecture (Based on Open Source Repo and Industry Patterns)**

Scout’s backend architecture likely follows these patterns:

| Layer                  | Functionality                                                                                   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CLI/API Layer**      | Accepts user input (research topic), launches research workflow                                |
| **Workflow Manager**   | Reads `config.json`, determines which agents and models to use                                 |
| **Agent Layer**        | Modular Python agents for discrete tasks (search, summarization, synthesis, etc.)              |
| **LLM Provider Layer** | Abstraction for calling different LLM APIs (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.), with API key management     |
| **Output Layer**       | Aggregates agent outputs, generates Markdown/HTML reports                                      |
| **Logging Layer**      | Structured logging of all actions and results                                                  |

- **Agents** act as orchestrators, chaining LLM calls and post-processing results.
- **Provider modules** abstract away differences between LLM APIs.
- **Config-driven**: All orchestration is controlled via JSON configuration for flexibility.

---

### **Should You Use Scout?**

**Scout is a good fit if you:**
- Need to automate research and report generation using the latest LLMs.
- Want a modular, extensible system that can adapt to new models/providers.
- Prefer structured, reproducible outputs (Markdown/HTML).
- Are comfortable configuring Python-based tools and managing API keys.

**Scout may not be ideal if you:**
- Require a GUI or non-CLI workflow.
- Need real-time, interactive research (it’s more batch/report-oriented).
- Don’t want to manage API keys or Python environments.

---

### **Summary**

Scout (www.scout.new) is a modular, agent-based research automation tool that leverages multiple LLMs to generate deep research reports. Its backend is driven by a configuration file, with agents orchestrating LLM calls and outputting structured reports. It is best suited for users seeking automated, extensible research workflows and comfortable with Python-based tooling[1].

Answer from Perplexity: pplx.ai/share   Absolutely! Here’s a wireframe and technical breakdown of the Scout.new workflow and interface, based directly on your screenshots. This will help your developer understand both the user experience and the architecture needed to deliver it.

1. Wireframe Overview
A. Welcome / Landing Screen
![Welcome Screen](https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/private/user_uploads/62143253/d489e3e6-b9e4-49e4-b366-34c4c6accccf/imageBackground:** Animated, soft pastel gradient for a calming, modern feel.

Greeting: Centered, personalized ("Hey Nathan, Got work? Let’s jam!").

Prompt Bar: Large, central input for natural language tasks (“Let Scout do it for you…”).

Quick Actions: Row of icons/buttons below the input for common workflows (Research, Create, Plan, Analyze, Learn).

Branding/Status: Subtle “Scout Alpha” tag and optional status/learn more link.

B. Main Workspace
![Main Workspace](https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/private/user_uploads/62143253/c90b8107-8e98-4c35-b34e-3debf08cd768/imageHeader:** Project/task title at the top (e.g., "Plan Multi-LLM App with Gemini API & Scout").

Three Main Panels:

Timeline (Left):

Vertical list of project steps/tasks.

Each step animates in as Scout progresses.

Selecting a step shows details in the center.

Files (Center):

List of generated files (Markdown, images, requirements, etc.).

Click to preview/edit/download.

Live code/markdown editor for selected file.

Preview (Right):

Live rendering of selected file or app preview.

If not available, shows a friendly mascot/placeholder.

Chat/Agent Panel (Bottom or Side):

Ongoing conversation with Scout’s agent.

User can send follow-up prompts or clarifications.

Animated Feedback:

All new steps, files, and messages animate smoothly into view.

Progress indicators show ongoing operations.

2. Technical Architecture (for Devs)
Frontend
Framework: React (with TypeScript recommended for type safety)

State Management: Zustand, Redux, or React Context for global state (user, project, files, chat)

Styling: TailwindCSS or CSS-in-JS for rapid, themeable UI

Animation: Framer Motion or React Spring for smooth transitions/animations

Panels/Layout: CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive, resizable panels

Key Components
Component	Description
WelcomeScreen	Animated background, greeting, prompt bar, quick actions
TimelinePanel	Displays project steps, updates live, clickable for details
FilesPanel	Lists files, enables editing/downloading, integrates code/markdown editor
PreviewPanel	Renders live previews (Markdown, diagrams, or app UI), shows placeholder if not available
ChatPanel	Shows agent/user conversation, handles prompt/response, animates new messages
Header	Shows project/task title, status, and actions
Backend
API Server: FastAPI or Flask (serves as orchestrator)

LLM Integration: Calls out to Gemini, OpenAI, or other LLM APIs for research, planning, code generation

Agent Orchestration: Python-based agent modules handle workflow steps (plan, generate, refine, summarize)

File Storage: Local disk, S3, or database for generated files/artifacts

Session/Project State: Redis or database to persist user projects, files, chat history

Workflow Logic
User submits prompt →

Backend agent parses and plans (calls LLM, generates steps/files) →

Frontend receives updates (steps, files, previews) via API/websockets →

UI panels animate in new content (timeline steps, files, chat messages) →

User interacts (edits files, sends follow-ups, downloads artifacts) →

Agent refines output and updates UI in real time

3. Animation & Visual Effects
Panel Transitions:
Panels slide/fade in as the user navigates or as new content appears.

Timeline Steps:
Steps animate in sequence, with checkmarks or highlights on completion.

File Drops:
New files “drop” into the Files panel with a bounce or fade effect.

Preview Updates:
Previews fade in or swap smoothly; mascot placeholder animates if no preview.

Chat:
Messages animate line-by-line, with typing indicators for the agent.

4. Sample User Flow
User lands on animated welcome screen, enters a prompt.

Scout agent responds, timeline and files panels populate step by step.

User clicks on a file, edits in place, or downloads.

Preview panel updates as files/apps are generated.

User chats with agent, refines plan, and watches all changes animate live.

5. Summary Table for Dev
UI Zone	Key Features & Tech	Animation/UX Notes
Welcome	React, pastel CSS, input, quick actions	Fade in, bounce, soft transitions
Timeline	List, live updates, clickable	Slide in, checkmark on complete
Files	List, edit/download, code/MD editor	Drop in, highlight, fade
Preview	Live render, mascot placeholder	Fade in/out, smooth swap
Chat	Agent/user messages, typing indicator	Animate line-by-line
Give this to your developer as a blueprint for building the Scout.new experience.
