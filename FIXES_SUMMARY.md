   - Configured appropriate Access-Control headers for secure communication

2. **Socket.IO Connection Problems**
   - Implemented connection parameter fixes for Socket.IO clients
   - Added transport fallback system (websocket â†’ polling)
   - Created debugging tools for Socket.IO troubleshooting (Ctrl+Alt+D)
   - Implemented connection event logging and monitoring

3. **Missing API Endpoints**
   - All NixOS workspace endpoints have been implemented and tested
   - Added complete set of CRUD operations for workspace management

   - Completed Mama Bear chat API with error handling

4. **Desktop Integration**
   - Created proper Windows desktop shortcuts with icons
   - Enhanced launcher script with automatic backend detection
   - Added debug mode option for troubleshooting
   - Implemented proper error handling for dependency issues

## Technical Improvements

### Electron App Enhancements
- Updated `webPreferences` to handle CORS and WebSocket connections
- Added session request/response handlers to modify headers in-flight
- Created custom CSS for Socket.IO integration components
- Added debugging panel that can be toggled with keyboard shortcut

### Socket.IO Fixes
- Configured proper transport options (websocket with polling fallback)
- Added reconnection parameters for better stability
- Implemented monitoring for connection events
- Created test page for Socket.IO connectivity validation

### Desktop Integration
- Created Windows shortcuts using VBScript
- Added automatic backend detection and startup
- Implemented debug mode with verbose logging
- Added dependency checking to launcher

## Testing and Validation

All critical components have been tested and verified:

- Backend API endpoints respond with 200 status codes
- Socket.IO real-time communication works for chat and terminals
- CORS preflight requests are handled correctly
- Mama Bear chat returns valid responses
- Scout project status returns correct data format
- Desktop app launches and connects to backend
- Shortcut creation works properly

## Next Steps

While all critical issues have been resolved, here are recommended next steps:

1. Add automated test suite for regression testing
2. Create backup system for Mama Bear memory data
3. Implement more robust error recovery for lost connections
4. Add user preferences for desktop app settings
5. Create installation package for easier distribution
