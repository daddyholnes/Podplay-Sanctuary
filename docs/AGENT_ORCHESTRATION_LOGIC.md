# Podplay Sanctuary Agent Orchestration Logic (v1)

## Purpose
This document outlines the logic required for robust, agentic control and orchestration in Podplay Sanctuary. It serves as a design brief for future enhancements and as a checklist for current capabilities. The goal is to empower Mama Bear and other agents with full, dynamic control over workspaces, tools, and collaborative features—locally and in the cloud.

## 1. Agent Orchestration Core
### 1.1 Agent Creation & Registration
- **Logic:**
  - Ability to spawn new agents (Mama Bear, Scout, Workspace agents) dynamically.
  - Register agents with a central directory for discovery and communication.
  - Assign roles (lead, workspace, research, etc.) and capabilities at creation.
- **Why:**
  - Enables multi-agent workflows, parallel tasks, and future agent collaboration.

### 1.2 Agent Lifecycle Management
- **Logic:**
  - Start, stop, pause, resume, and destroy agents programmatically.
  - Track agent state (active, idle, error, completed).
  - Persist agent state for restoration after restart.
- **Why:**
  - Supports robust, recoverable workflows and resource management.

### 1.3 Agent-to-Agent (a2a) Communication
- **Logic:**
  - Secure, structured messaging between agents (e.g., Mama Bear delegates to Scout).
  - Support for both synchronous (request/response) and asynchronous (event-driven) messages.
- **Why:**
  - Enables delegation, collaboration, and distributed problem solving.

## 2. Workspace & Environment Management
### 2.1 Dynamic Workspace Provisioning
- **Logic:**
  - Create, configure, and tear down workspaces on demand (NixOS, Docker, code-server, etc.).
  - Assign agents to workspaces and track ownership/context.
- **Why:**
  - Allows seamless transition between chat, code, and live preview environments.

### 2.2 Workspace Orchestration API
- **Logic:**
  - Expose REST/gRPC endpoints for workspace creation, status, and control.
  - Integrate with VM/container managers (Docker, Nix, Cloud Run).
- **Why:**
  - Enables external tools (including Mama Bear) to automate environment setup.

### 2.3 Persistent Workspace State
- **Logic:**
  - Save and restore workspace state (files, open editors, terminal history).
  - Link workspace state to user/session and agent memory.
- **Why:**
  - Delivers a true “Sanctuary” experience—pick up exactly where you left off.

## 3. Tooling, Extensions & MCP Integration
### 3.1 MCP Toolkit Integration
- **Logic:**
  - Agents can discover, install, and use MCP tools/extensions in any workspace.
  - API for listing available tools, installing, activating, and removing them.
- **Why:**
  - Empowers agents with new capabilities on demand (e.g., browser, codegen, search).

### 3.2 Extension & Plugin Management
- **Logic:**
  - Full VS Code extension support (install, update, configure, remove) via API/agent.
  - Theming/skinning support for Sanctuary branding.
- **Why:**
  - Ensures a customizable, accessible, and extensible developer environment.

---

## 4. Multi-Modal Interaction & Collaboration
### 4.1 Real-Time Collaboration
- **Logic:**
  - Agents and users can co-edit, chat, and share files in real time.
  - Presence and activity tracking (who is doing what, where).
- **Why:**
  - Enables pair programming, live debugging, and multi-agent teamwork.

### 4.2 Multi-Modal Input/Output
- **Logic:**
  - Support for text, voice, video, file uploads, and code execution in all environments.
  - Agents can process, transcribe, and act on multi-modal inputs.
- **Why:**
  - Delivers a modern, accessible experience for all workflows.

---

## 5. AI Model Orchestration & Memory
### 5.1 Model Routing & Switching
- **Logic:**
  - Dynamically select and switch between AI models (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex, etc.) per agent/task.
  - Fallback and error handling for unavailable models.
- **Why:**
  - Ensures best-in-class results and resilience.

### 5.2 Persistent Agent Memory
- **Logic:**
  - Agents store and retrieve context, chat history, and workflow state (mem0.ao integration).
  - Memory scoped per agent, workspace, and user.
- **Why:**
  - Provides continuity, personalization, and learning over time.

---

## 6. Security, Access, and User Management
### 6.1 Auth & Permissions
- **Logic:**
  - Secure authentication for users and agents (Firebase Auth, OAuth, etc.).
  - Role-based access control for all actions and resources.
- **Why:**
  - Protects user data and system integrity.

### 6.2 Audit & Monitoring
- **Logic:**
  - Log all agent actions, workspace changes, and critical events.
  - Real-time monitoring and alerting for errors or security issues.
- **Why:**
  - Enables trust, debugging, and compliance.

---

## 7. Future/Advanced Features (For Next Design Phase)
- **Autonomous agent swarms** (dynamic agent teams)
- **Visual workflow builder** (drag-and-drop agent/task orchestration)
- **Self-healing agents** (auto-restart on failure)
- **Marketplace for agent skills/tools**
- **Full cloud/local hybrid orchestration**

---

## Task Master Update
- This logic document is now the source of truth for agent orchestration requirements.
- Next: Review, design, and implement missing features as prioritized by Nathan and the team.
