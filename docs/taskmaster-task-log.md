## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Frontend
- Fixed all JSX/TSX structure errors in `MainChat.tsx`.
- Successfully integrated Logo component in chat header (shows current model or defaults to Gemini).
- Frontend builds and compiles cleanly (`npm run build` passed).

### Backend
- Python virtual environment created in `/backend`.
- Flask installed and environment activated.
- Fixed import/export errors in `integration_api.py` and `integration_test.py` (added alias, fixed indentation).
- Backend integration tests now import and run (no ImportError).

---

## üü£ In Progress / Next Steps

1. **Backend API Test Environment:**
   - Flask server is being started in the virtual environment.
   - Will re-run backend API tests once server is up to verify `/api/models` and other endpoints.

2. **Documentation & Planning:**
   - Reviewed `podplay-production-plan.md` for next module priorities and architecture.

3. **Incremental UI Enhancements:**
   - Next: Model switcher, mini app grid, or Scout workspace integration (confirm priority with Nathan).
   - Continue sensory-friendly, modular UI approach.

4. **Testing & QA:**
   - Expand frontend and backend test coverage.
   - Visual regression tests for Logo and UI modules.

---

## ‚è≥ Blockers / Notes
- Some backend API tests require the Flask server to be running (connection refused if not).
- No critical code bugs remain in current integration points.

---

## üéØ Immediate Next Actions
- [ ] Confirm Flask server is running, re-run backend API tests.
- [ ] Confirm next UI priority with Nathan (model switcher, mini app grid, or Scout workspace).
- [ ] Continue incremental improvements per production plan.

---

**Summary:**
- Podplay Sanctuary frontend and backend are structurally sound and ready for next-phase integration and testing.
- All major blockers from previous session are resolved.
- Awaiting backend server readiness and next UI direction from Nathan.
